Vircadia is an open-source project, so all of our code and documentation is available for you to look at. You too can contribute to our endeavor for the metaverse!
Our main `GitHub repository <https://github.com/kasenvr/project-athena>`_ contains the source to many of the components of our software for creating virtual worlds.
There are tons of ways you can contribute to the various parts that make up Vircadia.

-------------
Documentation
-------------
You can help create and maintain the documentation in several ways:

- Report errors or missing information to the `Github issue tracker <https://github.com/kasenvr/vircadia-docs-sphinx/issues>`_.
- Create or change documentation pages and open a `PR (pull request) on Github <https://github.com/kasenvr/vircadia-docs-sphinx/pulls>`_.
- `Review changes <https://github.com/kasenvr/vircadia-docs-sphinx/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A"needs+review">`_ to the documentation on Github. We would like to have two reviewers for most changes, as there are always things that the writer and the first reviewer overlook.


-----------
Translation
-----------
As an international project, Vircadia relies on translators to be able to reach users that do not speak English.
Currently the only component that has translation support is the documentation.
You can help translating using our online translation system `Weblate <https://weblate.vircadia.dev>`_ by either submitting translations or becoming a maintainer for your language and checking translations before they make it into the documentation.
More information on translating the documentation can be found in its `README <https://github.com/kasenvr/vircadia-docs-sphinx/blob/master/README.md>`_.

---------
Donations
---------
Most, if not all, of us work voluntarily without any payment.
While we do not have an entity to manage donations, you can donate to specific members of the team via various services like PayPal, Patreon, or Github Sponsors.
A list of members you can donate to is available on the :doc:`donate page <contribute/donate>`.

You can also put bounties on specific features you want to see implemented or issues you want to see fixed, by leaving a comment on our `issue tracker <https://github.com/kasenvr/project-athena/issues>`_.
Of course, bounties are also an option for other parts of the project like the documentation.
The bounties are based on trust, so if you are unsure about something speak to a core developer or bring it up at a community or developer meeting.
Most of the developers are highly trained and experienced, normally earning upwards of 40$ an hour on the free market. Keep that in mind if you want to see something done that no one else is personally interested in.

-----------
Development
-----------
You can help the general development of the Vircadia project without being much a of a developer yourself by:

- filing issues on our `issue tracker <https://github.com/kasenvr/project-athena/issues>`_,
- helping to narrow down those issues,
- or `testing pull requests <https://github.com/kasenvr/project-athena/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A"needs+QA+(testing)">`_.

If you are a developer, you can contribute directly to the project via pull requests. Keep the `guidelines <https://github.com/kasenvr/project-athena/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ in mind when contributing to the main software.
Some additional information can be found in the :doc:`Developer Section <developer>`.
An important job for developers that have become more accustomed to the platform is `code reviews <https://github.com/kasenvr/project-athena/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A"needs+CR+(code+review)">`_ of open pull requests.

Miscellaneous work
------------------
There is also a lot of miscellaneous work that comes up every now and then:

- 2D art like posters or banners,
- 3D models,
- scripts,
- video editing,
- and so on.

It is tremendously helpful for a developers to have someone they can ask when they need work done outside of their area of experience.
