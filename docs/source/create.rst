Vircadia enables people connected by interest, community, and friendship to come together and express their creativity with each other. We invite you to personalize your own experience by creating avatars and content, or developing apps and scripts. To truly make the metaverse your own, creating your own world or building your immersive project using the free and openly licensed Vircadia engine is encouraged!

No matter your level of expertise, Vircadia provides the tools you need to create anything you can imagine.
