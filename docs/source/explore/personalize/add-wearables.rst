Put On Wearables
###################################

You can customize your avatar's appearance by adding wearables, such as a pirate's hat, a pair of sunglasses, or even a pair of trousers that you designed. Like avatars, you can use your imagination to create your own.

Wear Your Own Wearable
-----------------------------

You can put on a :doc:`wearable that you created <../../create/wearables>`. All wearables must be hosted in the cloud before they can be used with Vircadia. Examples of cloud storage options include Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, GitHub, or Microsoft Azure.

Once you know the URL for your wearable's FBX file, then put it on your avatar:

1. In Interface, pull up your tablet or HUD and click on **Avatar**.
2. In the **Avatar** window, click the hat icon next to 'Wearables'.

3. Click 'Add custom' at the top of the window.
4. Enter the .fbx file's URL and click 'Confirm'.
5. Select the joint you'd like to use for your wearable. For example, a hat would be on your head, and fairy wings would be on your spine.
6. Fine tune the placement using the 'Position' and 'Rotation' options.
7. Check 'Is soft' if the item is rigged with your skeleton. This allows the item to move and bend with the avatar as it moves.
8. Click 'Save'.
